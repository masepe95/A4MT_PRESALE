                        <!-- Text -->
                        <p>If you purchase a Subscription, you must pay all fees associated with your account for that
                            Subscription, including applicable taxes and charges for additional
                            services not included as part of your Subscription. The charge will be made in accordance
                            with the billing terms in effect at the time of purchase. If you purchase a Subscription
                            that is charged in full at the time of purchase, you must pay the full cost of the next
                            subscription period by the first day of that period for each
                            renewal period of that Subscription. For each Subscription, the charge remains for each
                            subscription period, regardless of whether you access the services or the
                            Site during a subscription period. Even if you do not use the subscription, you are
                            responsible for the subscription fees until you cancel it or until it is otherwise
                            terminated. For more information on canceling your Subscription, see section 19.2
                            Termination and Cancellation below.</p>

                        <h5 class="s-24 w-700"><span>15.2</span> Billing</h5>
                        <!-- Text -->
                        <p>You must provide valid credit card information at the time of purchase to allow payment for
                            the initial subscription period of a Subscription. For any Subscription
                            with automatic renewal, your Subscription will renew at the end of the initial Subscription
                            Period (the "Billing Date") and at the end of each subsequent
                            subscription period until you notify us that you wish to terminate the Subscription under
                            these subscription conditions or until the Subscription is otherwise
                            terminated. If you do not notify us, your credit card will be automatically charged for the
                            renewal period of your Subscription on the Billing Date. If the purchase
                            date is between the 29th and the 31st day of any month, your Billing Date for renewals in
                            months with fewer days will fall on the last day of the month.
                            A4ManagementTools may change your Billing Date in subsequent renewal periods without notice.
                            This will be reflected in a proportional charge on your account
                            based on the number of days elapsed since the Billing Date of your last renewal charge.
                            Unless A4ManagementTools notifies you otherwise in advance under
                            these Subscription Terms, the renewal charge will be the original purchase price for the
                            Subscription. You must pay A4ManagementTools the fees associated
                            with your Subscription. Additional discounts may be available to members who purchase
                            multiple months in advance or as part of certain promotions.</p>

                        <p>A4ManagementTools may terminate your use of all or part of the Services or Subscriptions at
                            its sole discretion. As your sole remedy, we will refund any prepaid
                            fees specifically related to the current period of that Subscription.
                            If you do not pay by the Billing Date, as described in the Billing section above, you may
                            correct your credit card information and pay the outstanding amounts
                            within 30 days of your Billing Date. If you have not made any payment on your Subscription
                            within 30 days of your Billing Date, A4ManagementTools has the right
                            to suspend the service and terminate that Subscription.
                            Your right to use a Subscription is subject to any limits set by A4ManagementTools or your
                            credit card issuer. If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or
                            your charge is returned for any reason, including a chargeback, A4ManagementTools may, at
                            its discretion, suspend or terminate your account access, which will
                            result in the termination of these Terms and our obligations under them. If a charge to your
                            credit card is declined, A4ManagementTools will retry up to a
                            maximum of five charges on that card over a thirty-day period.
                            If you wish to reactivate your account after termination, there will be no setup or
                            reactivation fees. However, if your account was terminated for non-payment, it
                            will only be reactivated after A4ManagementTools receives the full outstanding amount. If an
                            expired account is reactivated, the new term starts from the
                            reactivation date.</p>

                            they were never issued.
                            You can cancel your Subscription at any time within your account settings. After canceling,
                            your Subscription will remain active until the end of the paid period.

                            arisen or may arise between you and A4ManagementTools, whether arising out of or related to
                            these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Site, any
                            advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved
                            exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, in
                            accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert claims
                            in small claims court if your claims qualify. Notwithstanding the above,
                            A4ManagementTools may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual
                            property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. By entering into
                            these Terms, you and A4ManagementTools waive the right to a jury trial or to participate in
                            a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator,

                            resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Swiss International Arbitration Rules of the
                            Swiss Chambers' Arbitration Institution (the "Swiss Rules" of the "SCAI" –
                            Swiss Chambers' Arbitration Institution) in force at the date the arbitration request is
                            submitted according to said Regulation. The number of arbitrators is three.
                            The seat of arbitration is Ascona, Switzerland (unless the parties agree to a foreign seat).
                            The arbitration proceedings are conducted in Italian. The parties may
